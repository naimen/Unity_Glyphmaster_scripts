# Glyphmaster_Unity_scripts
This repo contains the script I have written for my hoppy game project "Glyph master"

The project is just a proof of concept to me, after I realized how boring the concept become, the project is left unfinished.

The concept is simple, a scroll shooter game where the player must type a key sequnce to shoot, the key sequnce can thus be arranged such it feels like drawing a glyph, hence the name Glyphmaster.
